# telegram-bot
Personal Telegram Bot API implementation written in TypeScript for Node.js.  
Meant as a personal project to get more understanding of implementing an API client in Node.js/TypeScript.  
Much fun is had, still use it as an personal remind me system and for fun idiotic features i can come up with.

# Use
Doubt anyone can use it without much hacking the source since it is build pretty specific for my own VPS.  
If you are searching for a working API client try [this](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api "Node.js Telegram Bot API") as it was most of my inspiration.  
Use `tsc` to compile the typescript if you're up for the challenge
